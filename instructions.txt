Additional notes :
1. Please note this code uses Selenium to scrape the data. This might open the Chrome browser automatically and run through it. Please don't panic.
2. Selenium is required because this website uses lot of Javascipt, hence it cannot be scraped simply using BeautifulSoup.
3. The scraped data contains some special characters. This behaviour is expected only.
